Connoisseur is a one stop shop where you get to see the wonders of modern Image Captioning technology.
"Calculus isn't useful", you say. Well, tell that to the Backprop that made this possible.
And also Attention Model. And the Inception Embeddings. And the GRUs. And the tokenizer.

## Model

Built with Tensorflow and Keras, trained on the ~400,000 captions on ~80,000 and corresponding captions in the MS-COCO dataset. 

Created custom Attention model, RNN model, and CNN embedder
